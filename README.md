# High-quality-Figures-using-MATLAB
# Introduction
This MATLAB code is designed to facilitate the creation of high-quality figures by providing a structured workflow divided into five main steps. Whether you are visualizing scientific data, engineering results, or any other dataset, this code aims to streamline the process of generating publication-ready figures for paper and Thesis.

By following these structured steps, this code aims to simplify the figure creation process and empower users to generate professional-looking visualizations with minimal effort. Whether you are a researcher, scientist, engineer, or student, this tool can be a valuable asset in creating impactful visual representations of your data.

# Steps:  
## 01- Load Data:
Effortlessly load your dataset into MATLAB Workspace, allowing for seamless integration with the plotting functions. This step ensures that your data is ready for visualization without the need for extensive pre-processing.

## 02- Plot Data
Utilize powerful plotting functions to create visually appealing and informative figures. The code supports a variety of plot types, enabling you to effectively convey your data's key insights.

## 03- Figure Property
Customize the overall appearance of your figure by adjusting properties such as  figure size. This step empowers you to tailor the visual style to match your specific requirements and size preferences.

## 04- Axes Property
Fine-tune the properties of individual axes to enhance the clarity and interpretability of your figures. Adjust axis labels, ticks, color schemes, fonts, and other parameters to ensure that your audience can easily understand the presented information.

## 05- Save Figure
Save your finalized figure in various formats, such as PNG, PDF, or EPS, to accommodate different publication requirements. This step ensures that your high-quality figure is ready for inclusion in reports, papers, or presentations.

## Tips and Tricks
* For best practice, I suggest running the code by section (Ctrl+Enter) after making the necessary modifications for your case.
* A basic understanding of LaTeX symbols is recommended.
* If you're a LaTeX user, save your figure as 'EPS'; for MS Word users, save it as 'PNG' with a high resolution (e.g., 600).
* To add arrows and text to the figure, save it as 'EPS', then open the EPS file with Inkscape for necessary modifications, avoiding long and complicated code.
* Use the same font as your document; for LaTeX users, 'CMU' is suggested in the script.
