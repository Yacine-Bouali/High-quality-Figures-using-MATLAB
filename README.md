# High-quality-Figures-using-MATLAB
# Introduction
This MATLAB code is designed to facilitate the creation of high-quality figures by providing a structured workflow divided into five main steps. Whether you are visualizing scientific data, engineering results, or any other dataset, this code aims to streamline the process of generating publication-ready figures for paper and Thesis.

For best practice, I suggest running the code by section (Ctrl+Enter) after the necessary modification for your case.

# Steps:  
## 01- Load Data:
Effortlessly load your dataset into MATLAB Workspace, allowing for seamless integration with the plotting functions. This step ensures that your data is ready for visualization without the need for extensive pre-processing.

## 02- Plot Data
## 03- Figure Property
## 04- Axes Property
## 05- Save Figure
